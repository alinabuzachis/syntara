# Execution State Enrichment System

This directory contains the execution state inference system for the workflow builder. It enriches workflow **activities** (canvas **steps**; React Flow **nodes** in UI code) and edges with execution state information for visualization in the execution view.

## Architecture Overview

The system uses two design patterns:

1. **Strategy Pattern**: Different structural step / activity types (loop, converge, conditional, approval) have specialized state inferrers
2. **Orchestrator Pattern**: The `ExecutionStateEnricher` class coordinates all inferrers and provides a unified API

## Core Components

### ExecutionStateEnricher (Orchestrator)

The main entry point for all execution state operations. Create a singleton instance and use it to enrich activities and determine edge statuses.

```typescript
import { ExecutionStateEnricher } from './utils/executionState'

// Create singleton instance
const enricher = new ExecutionStateEnricher()

// Enrich an activity with execution state
const enrichedActivity = enricher.enrichActivity(activity, executionStatus, activityStates, edges)

// Determine edge execution status
const edgeStatus = enricher.determineEdgeStatus(
  { source: 'task-1', target: 'task-2', sourceHandle: 'source' },
  activityStates
)
```

**Methods:**

- `enrichActivity<T>(activity, executionStatus, activityStates, edges): ActivityWithMetadata<T>`
  - Adds execution badge metadata
  - Adds backend state if available
  - Infers state for structural activities (loop, converge, conditional)
  - Marks activities as skipped when on non-taken branches
  - Sets default pending state for structural activities

- `determineEdgeStatus(edge, activityStates): 'passed' | 'pending'`
  - For branching edges: checks if target has started (indicates branch was taken)
  - For trigger and converge outgoing edges: checks if target has started
  - For regular edges: checks if source reached a terminal status

### State inferrers (Strategy Pattern)

Each structural activity type has a dedicated inferrer implementing the `NodeStateInferrer` interface:

#### LoopNodeStateInferrer

Infers execution state for loop activities based on their outgoing edges:

- **Completed**: Done edge target has started execution
- **Running**: Loop body edge target has started execution
- **Null**: Cannot infer (defaults to pending or skipped)

#### ConvergeNodeStateInferrer

Infers execution state for converge activities based on incoming steps:

- **Running**: At least one incoming activity is completed or failed
- **Completed**: All incoming activities are completed/failed OR any outgoing activity has started
- **Null**: All incoming activities are pending

#### ConditionalNodeStateInferrer

Infers execution state for conditional and approval activities based on branch targets:

- **Completed**: Any branch target (true/false or approved/rejected) has started
- **Null**: No branch has been taken yet

Used for both `condition` and `approval` activity types.

### Edge Helpers

Utility functions for working with edges:

```typescript
import { EdgeHelpers } from './edgeHelpers'

// Find edges from a specific handle
const doneEdges = EdgeHelpers.findEdgesBySourceHandle('loop-1', edges, 'done')

// Check if edge target has started
const hasStarted = EdgeHelpers.hasTargetStarted(edge, activityStates)

// Get all incoming/outgoing edges
const incoming = EdgeHelpers.getIncomingEdges('task-1', edges)
const outgoing = EdgeHelpers.getOutgoingEdges('task-1', edges)
```

### Workflow Traversal

Graph traversal utilities for detecting skipped activities and downstream state:

```typescript
import { WorkflowTraversal } from './traversal'

// Check if any downstream activities are pending/running
const hasPending = WorkflowTraversal.hasDownstreamPendingNodes('loop-1', activityStates, edges)

// Check if an activity should be marked as skipped
const isSkipped = WorkflowTraversal.shouldMarkAsSkipped('task-false', activityStates, edges)
```

## Execution State Inference Algorithm

The enrichment algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Direct Backend State**: If the activity has state from the backend, use it directly
2. **Structural inference**: For loop/converge/conditional activities, use the appropriate inferrer
3. **Skip detection**: If an activity is on a non-taken branch or unreachable, mark as skipped
4. **Default pending**: Structural activities with no other state default to pending

## Edge Status Determination

Edges can be in two states:

- **Passed** (solid line): Execution has traversed this path
- **Pending** (dashed line): Execution hasn't reached this yet

### Branching Edges

For edges with branch handles (`true`, `false`, `approved`, `rejected`, `done`, `loop`):

- Status determined by checking if the **target** activity has started
- This indicates which branch was actually taken during execution

### Regular Edges

For normal edges without special handles:

- Status determined by checking if the **source** activity has reached a terminal status (completed, failed, or cancelled)

### Trigger Edges

Edges from trigger activities (`trigger-0`, `trigger-1`, etc.):

- Marked as `passed` only after the target activity has started

## Adding a new structural step type

To add execution state inference for a new activity / canvas step type:

1. **Create an Inferrer**: Implement `NodeStateInferrer` interface in `nodeStateInference.ts`

   ```typescript
   export class MyNewNodeStateInferrer implements NodeStateInferrer {
     inferState(
       activity: Activity,
       edges: EdgeConnection[],
       activityStates: Map<string, ActivityState>
     ): ExecutionState | null {
       // Your inference logic here
       return null
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Register in Orchestrator**: Add to `ExecutionStateEnricher` constructor

   ```typescript
   constructor() {
     this.nodeInferrers = new Map([
       ['loop', new LoopNodeStateInferrer()],
       ['converge', new ConvergeNodeStateInferrer()],
       ['condition', new ConditionalNodeStateInferrer()],
       ['approval', new ConditionalNodeStateInferrer()],
       ['mynewnode', new MyNewNodeStateInferrer()], // Add your inferrer
     ])
   }
   ```

3. **Write Tests**: Create `MyNewNodeStateInferrer.test.ts` in `__tests__/`

## Design Decisions

### Why Strategy Pattern?

- **Isolated logic**: Each activity type's inference logic is self-contained and testable
- **Easy extension**: Adding new inferrers does not require modifying existing ones
- **Clear Responsibilities**: Each inferrer has a single, well-defined purpose

### Why Orchestrator Pattern?

- **Unified API**: BuilderFlow only interacts with one class (`ExecutionStateEnricher`)
- **Encapsulation**: All execution state logic is separated from the UI component
- **Testability**: The orchestrator can be tested independently from React components

### Why Singleton Instance?

- **Performance**: Avoids creating new inferrer instances on every enrichment call
- **Stateless**: Inferrers have no state, so a single instance is safe to reuse
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced object allocation during rendering

## Testing

All components have comprehensive test coverage (71 tests total):

- **ExecutionStateEnricher**: 18 tests
- **edgeHelpers**: 18 tests
- **traversal**: 17 tests
- **LoopNodeStateInferrer**: 6 tests
- **ConvergeNodeStateInferrer**: 7 tests
- **ConditionalNodeStateInferrer**: 7 tests

Run tests:

```bash
npm --workspace=@syntara/ui run vitest -- executionState
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Memoization**: Traversal functions use visited sets to avoid redundant graph walks
- **Early Returns**: Inferrers return as soon as state is determined
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Only creates new objects when state actually changes

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Loop Execution

```text
Loop → [loop] → Body Task → [loop-back] → Loop → [done] → Done Task
```

1. Loop starts pending
2. Body task starts → Loop becomes "running"
3. Body task completes, loops back
4. Done task starts → Loop becomes "completed"

### Scenario 2: Conditional Branch

```text
Condition → [true] → Task True
         → [false] → Task False
```

1. Condition starts pending
2. Task True starts → Condition becomes "completed", true edge "passed"
3. Task False never starts → Marked as "skipped", false edge remains "pending"

### Scenario 3: Converge

```text
Task A ↘
Task B → Converge → Task Next
Task C ↗
```

1. Converge starts pending
2. Task A completes → Converge becomes "running"
3. Tasks B and C complete → Converge becomes "completed"
4. OR: Task Next starts → Converge immediately becomes "completed"
