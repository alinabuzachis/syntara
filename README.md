# Nexus

A distributed multi-agent system. Nexus enables coordinated AI agents to work together on complex tasks.

## Developer Workflow

This project uses `uv` for dependency management and provides a comprehensive Makefile for development tasks.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 (strict version requirement)
- `uv` package manager

### Installation

1. **Install uv** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Clone and setup the project**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:syntara-orchestration/syntara.git
   cd nexus
   make install
   ```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies and setup project
make install

# Start the development server
make dev

# Run tests
make test-all

# Check code quality
make lint
```

### Project Structure

```

    └── main.py

tests/
└── api/          # API tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_api.py
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test-all

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run only unit tests
make test-unit

# Run tests in parallel (requires pytest-xdist)
make test-all-parallel
```

### Code Quality

This project enforces strict code quality standards:

```bash
# Format code
make format

# Check linting and types
make lint

# Run only type checking
make typecheck
```

**Type checking is mandatory** - all code must pass mypy type checking.

### Development Server

```bash
# Start development server (auto-reload enabled)
make dev
```

### Project Configuration

- **Dependencies**: Managed with `uv` (see `pyproject.toml`)
- **Code formatting**: Ruff
- **Type checking**: MyPy with strict configuration
- **Testing**: Pytest with coverage reporting

### Troubleshooting

**Dependencies not found?**
```bash
make install
```

**Server won't start?**
```bash
make check-deps
```

**Need to clean everything?**
```bash
make clean
make install
```
