    This publisher handles the translation of execution and activity data into
    WebSocket-compatible messages and publishes them to Valkey Streams using the

    The publisher supports three types of messages:
    - initial_snapshot: Sent on first activity sync with full execution state
    - activity_patch: Sent on incremental updates with JSON Patch operations
    - final_snapshot: Sent when execution reaches terminal state
